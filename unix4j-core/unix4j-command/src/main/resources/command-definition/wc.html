The wc utility reads from the input and, by default, writes the
number of lines, words, and bytes to the output.
</p>
<p>
The wc utility considers a word to be a non-zero-length string of characters
delimited by white space.
</p>
<p>
When any option is specified, wc reports only the information requested by
the specified options.
</p>
<p>
If only one count type is requested, the count is outputted as an integer. If
more than one count is requested, a fixed width formatting is used, with the
counts being right aligned. The width of each field is equal to the width of
the widest field (count) plus two characters.

<p>
	The grep utility shall search the input, selecting lines matching a pattern; the types of patterns
	are controlled by the options specified.
</p><p>
	By default, an input line shall be selected if any pattern, treated as an entire regular expression
	matches any part of the line excluding the terminating newline character(s). By default, each selected input
	line shall be written to the output.
</p><p>
	Regular expression matching shall be based on text lines. Since a newline character(s) separates or terminates
	patterns, regular expressions cannot contain a newline character(s). Similarly, since patterns are matched
	against individual lines (excluding the terminating newline character(s)) of the input,
	there is no way for a pattern to match newline character(s) found in the input.
</p><p>
	Regular expressions used in this command must be based on the Java regular expression syntax.

		<operand name="separatorChars" type="String">
			Use {@code separatorChars} as the field separator; 
			{@code separatorChars} is not considered to be part of a field 
			(although it can be included in a sort key). Each occurrence of
			{@code separatorChars} is significant (for example, two consecutive 
			{@code separatorChars} delimit an empty field). If not specified, 
			whilespace characters (tabs, spaces) are used as default field 
			separators; each maximal non-empty sequence of whitespace chars that
			follows a non-whitespace char is a field separator.
		</operand>
		<operand name="fieldStart" type="int">
			Define a key field that begins at {@code fieldStart} and ends at
			{@code fieldEnd} inclusive, unless {@code fieldStart} falls beyond 
			the end of the line or after {@code fieldEnd}, in which case the key
			field is empty.
			
			A field comprises a maximal sequence of non-separating characters 
			and, in the absence of a {@code separatorChar}, any preceding field
			separator.

			Define a key field that begins at {@code fieldStart} and ends at
			{@code fieldEnd} inclusive, unless {@code fieldStart} falls beyond 
			the end of the line or after {@code fieldEnd}, in which case the key
			field is empty. A missing {@code fieldEnd} means the last character
			of the line.

		<operand name="keydef" type="Keydef">
			The keydef argument is a restricted sort key field definition. When
			there are multiple key fields, later keys are compared only after

			specified, lines that otherwise compare equal are ordered as if none
			of the options -d, -f, -i, -n, or -k were present (but with -r still 
			in effect, if it was specified) and with all bytes in the lines 
			significant to the comparison. The order in which lines that still

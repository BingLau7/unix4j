	<methods>
		<method input="true">
			Reads from the standard input and compares adjacent lines, writing
			one copy  of each input line on the output. The second and 
			succeeding copies of repeated adjacent input lines are not written
			to the output.
			
			Note that repeated lines in the input are not detected if they are 
			not adjacent (see --global or -g option); sorted input lines always
			result in unique output lines. 
		</method>
		<method args="file" input="false">
			Reads from the specified input {@code file} and compares adjacent
			lines, writing one copy of each input line on the output. The 
			second and succeeding copies of repeated adjacent input lines are 
			not written to the output.
			
			Note that repeated lines in the input are not detected if they are 
			not adjacent (see --global or -g option); sorted input lines always
			result in unique output lines. 
		</method>
		<method args="path" input="false">
			Reads the file specified by its {@code path} and compares adjacent
			lines, writing one copy of each input line on the output. The 
			second and succeeding copies of repeated adjacent input lines are 
			not written to the output.
			
			Note that repeated lines in the input are not detected if they are 
			not adjacent (see --global or -g option); sorted input lines always
			result in unique output lines.

			Note that repeated non-adjacent lines in the input are only detected
			with the --global or -g option. In other words, unique output lines
			are guaranteed only if either (a) the --global or -g option is
			specified, or (b) the input lines are sorted.

 The cut utility cuts out selected portions of each line (as specified by list) 
 from each file and writes them to the standard output.  If no file arguments 
 are specified, cut reads from the standard input.  The items specified by list
 can be in terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited by a special
 character.  Column numbering starts from 1.
